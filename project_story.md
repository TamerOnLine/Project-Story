# 📖 Project Story – The Birth of a Library

## 🧠 The Idea (Conception)
- Date: 2025-06-28
- The concept emerged: a library that parses `README.md` files and generates structured indexes automatically.
- Goal: Help developers quickly extract meaningful navigation from long documentation.

---

## 🌱 Formation (The Embryo Takes Shape)
- Created local project folder: `markdown_indexer`.
- Initial experiments written in the `dev/` folder using throwaway scripts.
- Virtual environment initialized using `venv`.

---

## 🧰 The Assistants (Tools and Dependencies)
### Build Tools:
- Python 3.11
- pip, setuptools
- Git, GitHub

### Development Tools:
- pytest (testing)
- black, flake8 (code quality)
- logging (debugging)
- MkDocs (planned for docs)

---

## 🏥 Operating Room (Environment Setup)
Executed the following:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

The development environment is now isolated and ready.

---

## 👶 First Breath (Successful Import & Execution)
- First successful import:
  ```python
  from markdown_indexer import generate_index
  generate_index("README.md")
  ```
- This marks the first working heartbeat of the project.

---

## 🎨 Defining the Identity (Core Structure & API Sketch)
- Library name: `markdown_indexer`
- Primary function: `generate_index_from_readme(path: str) -> str`
- Initial modules:
  - `core.py`: main processing logic
  - `utils.py`: helper functions
  - `cli.py`: (planned for later CLI interface)

---

## 📦 Local Publishing (Editable Installation)
Installed the project in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Used from an external script successfully.
